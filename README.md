## 🔑 How It Works

1. User enters a city name  
2. JavaScript calls OpenWeather API using `fetch()`  
3. Loader spinner appears while data loads  
4. UI updates with:
   - main weather  
   - animated icon  
   - wind, humidity  
   - sunrise/sunset  
   - forecast cards  
5. Clicking a forecast card opens a details modal
